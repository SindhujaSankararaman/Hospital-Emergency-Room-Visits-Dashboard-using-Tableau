Hospital Emergency Room Visits Dashboard using Tableau
In this project, I utilized Tableau to conduct a comprehensive analysis of patients who came to the hospital's Emergency Room. The dataset used for the analysis can be found here.
I have deep delved into the data to answer the following business questions:
1.	How many individuals have utilized the services of the emergency room?
2.	What is the average level of satisfaction among patients receiving care in the emergency room?
3.	What is the typical amount of time patients spend in the emergency room ?
4.	Could you present a visualization detailing the hourly and weekday variations in average patient wait times? 
5.	Is it possible to visualize patient distribution within the emergency room based on age groups? 
6.	Could you create visual representations that display patient categories by their race and the departments from which they were referred?
Key Insights from the analysis:
•	A total of 9,216 patients utilized the services of the Emergency Room, indicating a significant volume of patient visits.
•	The average satisfaction score for patients receiving care in the Emergency Room is 4.99 out of 10.
•	Patients typically spend an average of 35.26 minutes waiting in the Emergency Room.
•	Designed a heatmap to visualize average patient wait times across different hours of the day and days of the week in the hospital's Emergency Room. This heatmap is a valuable tool for identifying patterns and making data-informed decisions to enhance ER operations. It allows healthcare professionals to optimize resource allocation, manage staffing, and improve the overall patient experience by addressing wait time issues during specific times and days.
•	Created an area chart to illustrate the number of patients by age in the Emergency Room. It's significant to note that the majority of patients fall within the age group of 19-65.
•	Created bar graphs to display patient categories by race and the departments from which they were referred. It's particularly notable that the White race category is the largest group, contributing to a patient volume of 2,571.
•	"It's noteworthy that 1,840 patients were referred from General Practice Departments. This information is crucial for healthcare administrators and staff as it indicates a significant number of patients originating from this department."
